It's served as-is, hopefully\n      the way you'd expect.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Operator can tell that this is meant to be HTML (and sets <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5\">the\n      <code>Content-Type</code> header</a> to <code>text/html</code>) because\n      the file has <code>.html</code> as its extension. If you want examples of\n      other media types, here's <a href=\"stuff/words.txt\">some plain text</a>\n      and <a href=\"stuff/pixels.jpg\">an image</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      If you're looking for something a little more interesting, check out <a\n      href=\"https://github.com/mkantor/operator/tree/master/samples/realistic-advanced\">this\n      fancier demo</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <details>\n      <summary>Footnote</summary>\n      You can make requests <a href=\"page.html\">with</a> and <a href=\"page\">without</a>\n      an extension on your URI path. Operator performs <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.4\">content\n      negotiation</a> using this extension as well as <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2\">the\n      <code>Accept</code> header</a>. If multiple content files coexist whose\n      paths only differ by extension, they act as alternative representations\n      for the same resource. \"Negotiation\" means that Operator automatically\n      picks whichever one best fits the requester's preferences. For example,\n      depending on whether your browser prefers <code>image/png</code> or\n      <code>image/webp</code>, you'll see a different image here:\n      <img class=\"inline\" src=\"negotiation/image\" />.\n    </details>\n  </body>\n</html>\n"
