    <h1>A basic demo</h1>

    <p>
      This is a simple website powered by <a href="https://github.com/mkantor/operator">Operator</a>.
      It's just a few static files. <a href="https://github.com/mkantor/operator/tree/master/samples/realistic-basic">The
      source is on GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/mkantor/operator/blob/master/samples/realistic-basic/page.html">This
      particular file</a> is just boring old HTML. It's served as-is, hopefully
      the way you'd expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operator can tell that this is meant to be HTML (and sets <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5">the
      <code>Content-Type</code> header</a> to <code>text/html</code>) because
      the file has <code>.html</code> as its extension. If you want examples of
      other media types, here's <a href="stuff/words.txt">some plain text</a>
      and <a href="stuff/pixels.jpg">an image</a>.
    </p>

      <summary>Footnote</summary>
      You can make requests <a href="page.html">with</a> and <a href="page">without</a>
      an extension on your URI path. Operator performs <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.4">content
      negotiation</a> using this extension as well as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2">the
      <code>Accept</code> header</a>. If multiple content files coexist whose
      paths only differ by extension, they act as alternative representations
      for the same resource. "Negotiation" means that Operator automatically
      picks whichever one best fits the requester's preferences. For example,
      depending on whether your browser prefers <code>image/png</code> or
      <code>image/webp</code>, you'll see a different image here:
      <img class="inline" src="negotiation/image" />.
