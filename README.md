# Operator

Operator is an experimental web server for static and dynamic content. You give
it [a directory](samples/realistic-basic) and it makes a website.

Operator serves static files the way you'd expect, but it can also serve
[dynamic content](samples/realistic-advanced) generated by handlebars templates
and executables.

## Installation

Operator is a single self-contained binary. At the moment, the best way to get
a binary for your platform is to build one yourself. First [install
Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html), then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mkantor/operator.git
cd operator
cargo build --release # This will take a while.
echo '{{#if true}}Hello, operator!{{/if}}' \
  | ./target/release/operator eval --content-directory=/dev/null
```
